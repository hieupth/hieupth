# Hieu Pham
I am a technopreneur and computer scientist with a strong interest in applying artificial intelligence to practical business and industrial applications. Outside of my daily work, I enjoy developing and documenting my ideas as open-source projects on GitHub during evenings and weekends. If you find any of them valuable, I welcome your support as a sponsor or contributor to help bring impactful solutions to life.
